# Memory-Pair-Game

### Description

* The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
* You have to pass 10 levels to win the game.
* Each level is harder than previous one: less clicks or more card types.
* To level up you have to find all matches within given number of clicks
* If there are no more clicks and you haven't found all matches, you will be returned to the first level of the game
* Of course, there is a bonus: if the first couple you opened is successful, you will get the heart - the ability to pay for playing this level again (no jumping back to the first level)
